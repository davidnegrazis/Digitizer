# Digitizer
A one or two player Unity3D survival game set in space.

### About
_Digitizer_ is a survival game made in C#. There are a few waves with increasingly difficult enemies that have unique abilities, a boss battle, and an infinite round after that to get high scores. There are powerups such as shields, enhancements to the player's weapon, and two-player specific powerups such as reviving a downed player and a death ray that connects the two players which can be used to damage enemies.

The players can also use points to purchase static turrets, upgrade powerups, and call an "Amberlance" to replenish their health.

In order to play two-player, the second player must attach an Xbox controller (or use another controller with additional software to emulate an Xbox controller).

### How to get playing
Download the `PlayDigitizer` zip folder, unzip it, and run `digitizer.exe` to play!
